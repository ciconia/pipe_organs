Wood pipes at Blumenroeder, July 2014
=====================================

Wooden pipes with tongue and groove assembly, a bottom board with foot, blade (biseau), lower lip, and optional stopper.

- prepare pipe side boards
  - pre-debit: mark and rough saw raw wood boards
    - select wood free of knots and cracks, and with straight grain.
    - allow extra length of 10cm for small pipes, 15-20cm for big pipes.
    - the façade boards should be of straight-grained quarter-sawn (or fake quarter-sawn) wood.
  - debit: joint, plane and cut boards
    - boards are brought to the desired thickness + 0.3mm, to be removed later  when doing the finish.
  - assembly: cut tongue and groove
    - choose the best side of each board and mark it as exterior
    - tongues on the side boards, grooves on the façade and back.
    - groove should be about 1-1.5mm deeper than tonge, 0.3mm wider than the tongue. The extra depth allows the glue to squeeze out in gluing, also allows the wood to work. The extra width is for easier assembly, and allows alignment of boards on gluing.
  - assembly: cut shoulder
    - the shoulder should be flush with the tongue (TODO: add a drawing of the assembly)
  - assembly: remove assembly tongue for lower lip
    - the tongue on the façade side of each side board should be removed up to the height of the lower lip
  - cut upper lip
    - mark upper end of lip on exterior of façade with a blade.
    - mark lower end of lip on interior of façade board with a blade.
    - cut lower end of lip on interior with a blade, progressively removing material with a chisel. the cut should be 3-4mm deep.
    - setup a jig to form the lip with either a router or a saw, aiming for uniformity and clean execution, leave 0.3-0.5mm of material for cleaning by hand.
      - The sides should be 1mm wider than the board thickness (for voicing?).
    - carefully clean lip with a shoulder plane, bringing the lip's edge to the correct thickness (1-2mm).


- prepare accessories: bottom board, blades, lower lips, optional stoppers
  - important: all accessories are aligned with the grain across the width of the pipe!
  - pre-debit: mark and rough saw wood boards
    - select wood free of knots.
  - debit: joint, plane and cut boards
